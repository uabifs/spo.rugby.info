Rugby is a game in which the object is to carry the ball over the opponents’ goal-line and force it to the ground to score.

It’s simple ... but complex
The above description may sound simple – but there is one catch. In order to go forward, the ball must be passed backwards. The ball can be kicked forwards, but the kicker’s team-mates must be behind the ball at the moment the ball is kicked.

This apparent contradiction creates a need for fine teamwork and great discipline, as little can be achieved by any one individual player. Only by working as a team can players move the ball forward towards their opponents’ goal-line and eventually go on to win the game.

Rugby has its unique aspects, but like many other sports it is essentially about the creation and use of space. The winners of a game of rugby will be the team of players who can get themselves and the ball into space and use that space wisely, while denying the opposing team both possession of the ball and access to space in which to use it.</p>
