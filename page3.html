<h1 style="text-align: center; text-size: 30px"> Player Welfare</h1> 
<p1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 30px; text-size: 30px;"> World Rugby’s Player Welfare strategy is to put the player first and to rely on an evidence-based approach for all decisions.</h1>

<h2 style="font-size: 40px; text-decoration-color: blue;"> Players Equipment</h2>
<h3 style="font-size:35px">Permitted Devices</h3>
<p1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px"> 
Permitted devices must carry the World Rugby Approved mark or a label showing the mark. This mark shows that the device has been independently tested and complies with the applicable performance specification.  

Only devices with a World Rugby Approved mark and listed on the World Rugby website as being compliant can be used in matches. 
If all instances of the mark or a label are removed from the device then it shouldn’t be considered compliant and can’t be used in matches. 
These requirements apply at all levels of the game.</p1>
